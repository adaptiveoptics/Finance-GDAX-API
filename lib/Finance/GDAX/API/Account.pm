=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a GDAX account object to examine accounts.

See Finance::GDAX::API::Request for details on API key requirements that
need to be passed in.

The HTTP response code can be accessed via the "response_code"
attribute, and if the request resulted in a response code greater than
or equal to 400, then the "error" attribute will be set to the error
message returned by the GDAX servers.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<get_all>

Returns an array of hashes, with each hash representing account
details. According to the GDAX API, currently these hashes will
contain the following keys and data:

The following represents the data structure from their current API
docs:

  [
      {
          "id": "71452118-efc7-4cc4-8780-a5e22d4baa53",

          "profile_id": "75da88c5-05bf-4f54-bc85-5c775bd68254"
      }
  ]

  id              Account ID
  balance         total funds in the account
  holds           funds on hold (not available for use)
  available       funds available to withdraw* or trade
  margin_enabled  [margin] true if the account belongs to margin profile
  funded_amount   [margin] amount of outstanding funds currently credited to
                  the account
  default_amount  [margin] amount defaulted on due to not being able to pay
                  back funding

However, this does not appear to be exactly what they are sending now.

    my $self = shift;
    $self->method('GET');
    $self->path('/accounts');
    return $self->send;
}

=head2 C<get> $account_id

The get method requires passing an account id and returns a hash of
the account information. Currently the GDAX API docs say they are:

The following represents the data structure from their current API
docs:

  {
      "id": "a1b2c3d4",
      "balance": "1.100",
      "holds": "0.100",
      "available": "1.00",
      "currency": "USD"
  }

  id 	         Account ID
  balance 	 total funds in the account
  holds 	 funds on hold (not available for use)
  available      funds available to withdraw* or trade
  margin_enabled [margin] true if the account belongs to margin profile
  funded_amount  [margin] amount of outstanding funds currently credited to
                 the account
  default_amount [margin] amount defaulted on due to not being able to pay
                 back funding

=cut

sub get {
    my ($self, $account_id) = @_;
    die 'Account ID is required' unless $account_id;
    $self->method('GET');
    $self->path("/accounts/$account_id");
    return $self->send;
}

=head2 C<history> $account_id

The history method returns an array of hashes representing the history
of transactions on the specified account_id.

The limit is 100 transactions - no paging has been implemented in this
API, through the GDAX API does support paging apparently.

The following represents the data structure from their current API
docs:

  [
      {
          "id": "100",
          "created_at": "2014-11-07T08:19:27.028459Z",
          "amount": "0.001",
          "balance": "239.669",
          "type": "fee",
          "details": {
              "order_id": "d50ec984-77a8-460a-b958-66f114b0de9b",
              "trade_id": "74",
              "product_id": "BTC-USD"
          }
      }
  ]

With different "type"'s meaning different "details" -- and those types
are:

  transfer Funds moved to/from Coinbase to GDAX
  match    Funds moved as a result of a trade
  fee      Fee as a result of a trade
  rebate   Fee rebate as per our fee schedule

sub history {

    die 'Account ID is required' unless $account_id;
    $self->method('GET');
    $self->path("/accounts/$account_id/ledger");
    return $self->send;
}

=head2 C<holds> $account_id

The holds method returns an array of hashes representing the holds placed on the $account_id account, which happen due to active orders or pending withdrawls.

The following represents the data structure from their current API
docs:

  [
      {
          "id": "82dcd140-c3c7-4507-8de4-2c529cd1a28f",
